# Semantic Segmentation on CamVid Dataset using U-Net.

This repository is made in attempt to implement the [U-Net paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597). We implemented the convolutional neural network architecture given in the paper. There are in total [32 classes](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/#ClassLabels).

## Semantic Segmentation
Semantic segmentation refers to the process of mapping/classifying each pixel in an image to a class label. It can also be referred to as **image classification** for pixels in an image. Its primary applications include autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction, robotics and photo-editing tools. It is very useful for delf-driving cars in which contextual information of the environment is required at each and every step while traversing the route.

## Network Architechture
The network architecture mentioned in the paper is used.
